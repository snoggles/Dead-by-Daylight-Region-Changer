# Dead-by-Daylight-Region-Changer
## Overview
Region Changer is a lightweight, easy-to-use tool for players of Dead by Daylight to manually select specific regions. This is especially useful for players with slower internet connections or those who want to bypass automatic server selection without relying on a VPN.

## How It Works
Dead by Daylight uses AWS GameLift servers to host its multiplayer sessions. These servers are distributed across multiple regions worldwide, such as North America, Europe, Asia, and others. The game usually determines the best region automatically based on latency and availability.

Region Changer works by modifying your system's hosts file to block specific AWS GameLift servers from responding. By selectively blocking access to unwanted regions, the game is forced to connect to the allowed region, giving you more control over your matchmaking experience.

## Features
- Lightweight: Minimalist design and low resource usage.
- Custom Region Selection: Choose your preferred server region with ease.
- No VPN Required: Avoid the hassle, cost, and higher ping of a VPN connection.
